## Project Overview

This project aims to build machine learning models for predicting manufacturing efficiency and detecting anomalies based on sensor data and network performance metrics. The dataset contains key features such as temperature, vibration, power consumption, network latency, error rates, and more.

Key goals include:
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Anticipating equipment failures based on sensor data and production performance.
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Identifying areas for resource allocation and process optimization in smart factories.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time detection of irregularities that can impact manufacturing performance.

## Dataset

The dataset is based on real-time sensor data from industrial machines, including:
- **Industrial IoT Sensor Data**: Temperature, vibration, power consumption, etc.
- **6G Network Performance Metrics**: Latency, packet loss, and communication efficiency.
- **Production Efficiency Indicators**: Defect rate, predictive maintenance score, error rate.
- **Target Column**: `Efficiency_Status` (High, Medium, Low) - Classification based on performance metrics.

You can access and download the dataset from the source [here](#).

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-manufacturing.git
cd intelligent-manufacturing
Usage
After setting up the environment, run the script to analyze the dataset and perform various tasks such as data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

Step 1: Load the Data
Make sure to load the dataset:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('path/to/dataset.csv')
Step 2: Preprocess the Data
The dataset contains missing values, which should be handled before model training:

python
Copy
Edit
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)  # Fill missing values with the mean
Step 3: Feature Scaling and Model Training
Scale your features and split the data for model training:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X = df.drop(columns=['Efficiency_Status'])
y = df['Efficiency_Status']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
Step 4: Model Evaluation
You can train and evaluate models using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {'n_estimators': [100, 200], 'max_depth': [10, 20, 30]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
Data Preprocessing
This section explains the preprocessing steps taken to clean and transform the data before modeling:

Handling Missing Data: The missing values are handled using mean imputation.
Feature Scaling: Standard scaling was applied to the features to ensure the model training process is efficient.
Categorical Encoding: Categorical variables were encoded using label encoding to convert them into numeric values suitable for machine learning models.
Modeling
We trained a RandomForestClassifier using grid search to find the best hyperparameters. The hyperparameters n_estimators and max_depth were tuned to optimize the model's performance.

Steps:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Scale features using StandardScaler.
Train multiple models, including Random Forest, and compare performance.
Evaluate models using cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation
We used several metrics to evaluate the models:

Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Model Comparison
We compared the performance of multiple models using a bar plot to display accuracy.

python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

results = {'Random Forest': 0.85, 'SVM': 0.80, 'Logistic Regression': 0.75}

plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
sns.barplot(x=list(results.keys()), y=list(results.values()), palette="coolwarm")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.ylabel("Accuracy")
plt.title("Model Accuracy Comparison")
plt.show()
